DS5110 Final Project Fall 2024 - Patient Request and Financial Information Database
===========

### Project Details
The goal of this project is to create a database for a charity medical foundation called the DPCA. The data in the dataset is collected from patients who go to the DPCA, where employees will ask patients various questions, filling out a Google Form that gets inputted into a Google Sheet that contains all the data. This charity foundation helps patients pay for their medical procedures via a reimbursement process, taking into account factors such as occupation, income, and alternate forms of financial support. The creation of this database would allow members of the foundation to easily perform data analysis and run queries on the data, creating static and dynamic visualizations and utilizing a dashboard to filter the data accordingly. This would provide the foundation valuable information on procedure requests and trends, as well as analysis of patient demographics and financials.

This project is maintained and contributed to by Mia Khan and Onn Ye Young.
