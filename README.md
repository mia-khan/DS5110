DS5110 Final Project Fall 2024 - Patient Request and Financial Information Database
===========

### Project Details
The goal of this project is to create a database for a charity medical foundation, called the DPCA, based off of written forms filled out by patients asking for financial aid for medical procedures. This charity foundation helps patients pay for their medical procedures, taking into account factors such as occupation, income, and alternate forms of financial support. The creation of this database would allow members of the foundation to easily perform data analysis and run queries on the data, creating static and dynamic visualizations and utilizing a dashboard to filter the data accordingly. This would provide the foundation valuable information on procedure requests and trends, as well as analysis of patient demographics and financials.

This project is maintained and contributed to by Mia Khan and Onn Ye Young.
